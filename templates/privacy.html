            <h2 class="h4">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Cycling Stats is a personal data visualization tool designed to help athletes analyze their performance. 
                By choosing to connect your Strava account to this application, you agree to the collection and processing 
                of your information as described in this policy. We are committed to transparency and ensuring that 
                your data remains under your exclusive control.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2 class="h4">Data Collection and Integration</h2>
            <p>
                Our application functions by integrating with the Strava API. When you authorize the application, 
                we collect specific data points required to generate your dashboard and maps. This includes your 
                public profile information (such as your name and athlete ID), your activity history (including 
                GPS coordinates, distance, and timestamps), and detailed performance metrics (including heart rate, 
                power output, cadence, and temperature). 
            </p>
            <p>
                This data is stored securely in our private database to allow for historical analysis and 
                trend tracking that may not be immediately available through the standard Strava interface.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h4">Strict Limitations on Data Use</h2>
            <p>
                We believe your athletic data belongs to you. Therefore, we operate under a strict set of limitations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Commercial Sale:</strong> We do not sell, trade, or provide your personal information or activity data to any third-party advertisers, data brokers, or marketing firms.</li>
                <li><strong>No AI Training:</strong> In accordance with the latest data protection standards, your data is never used to train, fine-tune, or develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, Large Language Models (LLMs), or machine learning algorithms.</li>
                <li><strong>No Public Sharing:</strong> Your data is stored for your personal view only. This application does not feature public feeds, leaderboards, or social sharing components that would expose your activities to other users.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2 class="h4">User Rights and Data Portability</h2>
            <p>
                You have the right to know what data we hold and the right to request its deletion. We have simplified 
                this process by providing a "Disconnect & Purge" feature within your account settings. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When you select this option, the application performs a complete and irreversible wipe of your records 
                from our system. This includes the removal of your athlete profile, all synchronized activity records, 
                and all high-resolution sensor streams (watts, heart rate, etc.). Furthermore, the application 
                will communicate with Strava to revoke the digital tokens used to access your account, ensuring no 
                further data synchronization can occur.
            </p>
